Description: To connect R results to github.com/npellet/visualizer project using my.cheminfo.org.
    This allows to interactively display data with R.
    R is a powerfull software for data analysis, however it lacks the possibility to display data in an interactive fashion.
    For example it is not possible to display a spectra and zoom in and out. With this package we offer the possibility to
    visualize the data in the browser. Data displayed in different modules can interact with each others, so it is possible
    to construct a tool to identify outliers in a PCA score plot and retreive the corresponding data.
