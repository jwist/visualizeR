# visualizeR
R package to connect R to github.com/npellet/visualizer project. R is a very rich and powerfull statistical language supported by a large and dynamic community. It is used in many fields of research, in particular to perform the multivariate analysis in non-targeted analysis. Although the analysis pipeline is fairly complete, a part of the analysis require visual inspection of the results. In that aspect, there is room for improvement. R graphics are not dynamic and cannot be zoomed in and out, as it is possible to do within the scilab<sup><a name="myfootnote1">1</a></sup> or matlab<sup><a name="myfootnote2">1</a></sup> graphical interfaces.
